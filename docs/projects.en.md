# My projects

## e-Learning

### CERN E-learning guidelines

This project is a documentation that I have created in order to provide a single, clear procedure for creating e-learning and training content at CERN.

#### Link

[Bilingual documentation](https://sukori.github.io/Learning_Guidelines/)
Note: this documentation is published on CERN's internal gitlab. The current public version reflects the state of the guidelines as they stood until June 2023.

#### Objectives

There were no guidelines for creating e-learnings at CERN. This documentation reflects the type of content I would have liked to receive in my first days in the job.

This documentation contains help on designing SCORM e-learning modules, for example created using **Storyline** or **Captivate**. There are also pre-built, ready-to-use module templates. Finally, there are elements on how to create videos using the [recording studio](https://technophil.dev/about/#cern-2020-2023) that I set up for the HR-LD team.

#### Design

This documentation is aimed at a potentially non-expert audience, while still being usable by expert users.

Visually, the [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme from [MKDOCS](https://www.mkdocs.org/) is used. It is easy to use and is commonly used in other CERN documentation.

#### Production

The documentation is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and published on the [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) instance internal to the CERN network. Markdown is already used by the CERN HR-LD team and Gitlab is the standard platform for deploying such documentation at CERN.

This documentation was produced with respect for the tools already in place and the users' prior knowledge.

### CERN Data Privacy

This is currently the only module I have produced that does not contain confidential information and for which I have received permission to publish the content here.

#### Objectives

The aim of this e-Learning is to make all CERN staff (over 15,000 people) aware of the organisation's specific data protection rules. CERN issues its own rules and the [CERN Data Protection Office](https://privacy.web.cern.ch/office-data-privacy-odp) (ODP) has commissioned this e-Learning module.

This e-Learning module is compulsory for anyone working on the CERN site.

#### Design

The colour code was imposed by CERN's Data Protection Office. The e-Learning module was part of a communication campaign that already had a defined branding.

As the module was compulsory for over 15,000 people, it had to be short. The target duration was 15 minutes. Put end to end, the audio tracks last around 11 minutes. Users take between 10 and 15 minutes to complete the module, according to the data collected in the **LMS**.

#### Production

The course was created using **Articulate Storyline 3**. The graphics were produced using **inkscape** and the audio was recorded using my *Shure SM7B* microphone and **Audacity** software. I recorded myself in both languages.

Given the scale of the project and the number of people involved as experts and reviewers, the project lasted 11 months until it was finally put online. In November 2023, one year after going online, the published version has not yet been updated and is still up to date.

#### Post mortem

The module has received generally positive feedback. Few bugs were reported and these were mainly related to the **safari** browser on *Mac* machines. 95% of CERN staff have completed the course. The remaining users are either newcomers or will receive reminders until the module is completed.

Given that there were more than 10 people involved in the design and review of the module, the effort required to complete the development of the module was spread over 11 months and was the subject of meticulous discussions.

The final product meets the requirements of CERN's ODP and is fully functional.

## Github

You can find personal projects on my repository [github.com/Sukori](https://github.com/Sukori).

### Technophil.dev

This website, which serves as my calling card as well as my experimentation with **mkdocs** and writing documentation in **markdown**.

### azmirabajra/Aphasia

Group project to develop an educational video game during the MALTT master's course (UNIGE). This game was designed with the help of Clickteam fusion and is aimed at people suffering from aphasia.

### tutos-live-chat

Live chat application based on `Node.js` technology, supported in particular by the `socket.io` library. Project carried out during the MALTT master's degree (UNIGE).

### C-experiments

I have very little opportunity to use my knowledge of `C` programming professionally. This repo is a way for me to refresh and develop my knowledge. I used the [Project Euler] site (https://projecteuler.net/) to find exercises.

### Csharp-experiments

As with `C`, I don't have the opportunity to use `C#` professionally, let alone outside of the **Unity** game engine. So I've continued to solve *Project Euler* problems in `C#`.

## Game jams

A game jam is an event similar to a hackathon. For a limited time, usually 48 hours, participants create a game based on a theme revealed at the start of the game jam. The medium is free: board game, video game, augmented reality, etc.

I took part in several editions of the [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/) and several editions of the [Epic Game Jam](https://epicgamejam.com/).

### Beetroot Kong

[Project page](https://globalgamejam.org/2023/games/beetroot-cong-4)

A platform game based on the first "Donkey Kong" game on the Nintendo Entertainment System (1983). Complete the course 4 times while avoiding the radioactive elements to win the game.

Developed with the **Unity** game engine

Made in **48 hours** during the **Global Game Jam 2023** at HEPIA Geneva (Switzerland).

I drew the characters using **infinite painter** on **Android tablet**.

### Brikolaïka

The video game was made in **45 hours** at the **Epic Game Jam** (Neuchâtel, Switzerland) with 5 other people using **Unreal engine 4**.

I created the 3D model and textures of the rabbit in **Blender**. I drew the other lore-related images with **Krita**.

### Home Sweet Home (Premium Bunker Edition)
