I am a founding and active member of the [AFODITECH] association (https://afoditech.ch/).

Through the association, my personal aim is to democratise the use of IT in education.

Today's technologies offer powerful tools to support trainers and learners.

However, the use of IT in training is not as democratised as you might think, and I hope to make my contribution by providing a framework for the use of technology in training.
