	## Technical skills

### instructional designering

I currently work as an instructional designer. More specifically, I have extensive expertise in the [Articulate 360](https://articulate.com/) suite and am actively developing e-learning modules. I'm open to other authoring tools such as [Adobe Captivate](https://www.adobe.com/ch_fr/products/captivate.html) or [H5P](https://h5p.org/).

Furthermore, in order to offer visually attractive and immersive e-learning modules, I know how to use [graphic design](#design-graphique) software, [video editing](#montage-video) software and [audio editing](#montage-audio) software. In this context, I've already had to equip and set up from scratch a recording studio dedicated to my corporate training team (HR Learning & Development).

Finally, I sometimes develop interactive web pages in [javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) or [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) applications with or without [React](https://reactjs.org/). I consider web development skills to be very important, particularly for setting up a learning environment that takes advantage of [xAPI](https://xapi.com/). At the moment, xAPI requires skills in **javascript** and few authoring tools integrate this standard effectively.

### Office suite

I can use [Microsoft Office 365](https://www.microsoft.com/fr-ch/microsoft-365/business?market=ch) for administrative work. I can also use its open source counterpart: [Libre Office](https://www.libreoffice.org/).

I regularly use Excel to analyse report data from the LMS in particular (checking enrolments, annual statistics, training reports).

My design skills enable me to lay out PowerPoint presentations that are clear and easy to read.

The *review* option in Word enabled me to work non-destructively on technical specifications for a call for tenders.

### Graphic design

I use [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/ch_fr/creativecloud.html) to create my e-learning modules.

I regularly use Adobe **Illustrator** to create the vector images that illustrate my e-learning modules. I use Adobe **Photoshop** to retouch photos and images as part of my work on creating training courses.

When the **Adobe** suite is not available, I use [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) as a counterpart to **Photoshop** and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) as a counterpart to **Illustrator**.

I'm very familiar with the 3D modelling software [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). I use it regularly to model *assets* for the video games I develop in my spare time and I also use it to model objects that I can then 3D print using my [Creality CR 10S](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/official-creality-cr-10s-3d-printer).

### Video editing

I use [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/ch_fr/creativecloud.html) to create e-learning modules.

I often use Adobe **Premiere Pro** to edit the videos that appear in the e-learning modules I create. I've also worked on a series of [videos presenting the heads of departments at CERN](https://videos.cern.ch/search?page=1&size=21&q=onboarding).

When the **Adobe** suite is not available, I use [Openshot video editor](https://www.openshot.org/) and [Davinci Resolve](https://davinciresolve.us.com/) as required.

For video recording, I use [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) which can handle green backgrounds as well as multiple video and audio inputs. This software can be used for recording or live broadcasting.

### Audio editing

I do most of my audio editing with [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/). I use it for editing and background noise reduction in voice-over recordings for e-learning or in videos.

Privately, I have an audio interface [TC-Helicon GOXLR](https://www.tc-helicon.com/product.html?modelCode=P0CQK) and its associated software, as well as a studio microphone [Shure SM7B](https://www.shure.com/fr-FR/produits/microphones/sm7b?variant=SM7B).

### Programming

I'm passionate about programming. Most of my programming projects are personal projects. My aim is to use my knowledge to develop e-learning modules that are ever more effective and integrated into my colleagues' working environment, in particular using [xAPI](https://xapi.com/).

All the languages I have learnt to date:

* [HTML](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Markup_Language), [CSS](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
* [javascript](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) ([vanilla](http://vanilla-js.com/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), others...)
* [C](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(language))
* [C#](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_sharp) (vanilla or integrated into [Unity game engine](https://unity.com/))
* [python](https://www.python.org/)
